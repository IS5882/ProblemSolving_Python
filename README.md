# ProblemSolving_Python
The problems in is this repo are mainly asked by several top tech companies. To the best of my knowledge none of those problems are not available on any coding/algorihtmic platform 
(leetcode, hackerrank etc). I attempted my best to solve them in optimum time and space, if you have a better solution or a test case that wouldn't pass my code kindly raise it as an issue.
